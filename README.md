# Stock prediction model using RNN

This notebook demonstrates the future price predcition of SBI stock using recurrent neural network (RNN) in tensorflow.
It also demonstrates a technique to identify the sudden attacks that occur in the stock prices and mitigate their impact on the
stock prediction trends. 

### Prerequisites

Python3
Jupyter-notebook

This book has been developed on windows system with anaconda environment.

Important Repositories/packages

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
math
datetime
os
tensorflow

### Installing

In anaconda prompt command pip install 'Package name' would install the required package along with all the dependencies.

Otherwise one can also use conda installation.
For more details check out https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html

For linux based systems pip install package commands can be directly run from normal command prompt to download package and 
its dependencies.

To install tensorflow one can use conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow if the above commands doesn't work

```
pip install pandas
or 
conda install pandas

```
